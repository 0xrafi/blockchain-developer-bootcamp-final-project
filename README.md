This is my final project for Consensys' Blockchain Developer Bootcamp. I conceived this idea on the 29th. I didn't start this project until the very last minute (sorry).

# Ape Pen (apen) (apin') (Ape Writers)

Apen is a collection of 5000 collectible NFT "pens" that allow an owner access into a haven for ape writers. Only 5000 pens can ever be minted.

Once you own a pen, you will be able to access a Shamir's Secret Sharing encrypted, IPFS decentralized personal writing space with your own private ape notes.
Each ape can mint anonymous "ape note" NFTs in their writing space and release them to the public, where they will be displayed on the Ape Pen writer's wall. Ape Notes are prohibitively expensive to mint, but an ape writer can mint as many notes as they choose.
